## Vendor Dimension Table

A dedicated vendor dimension table was created to centralize vendor-level metrics and risk classifications.

This approach improves:
- Model clarity
- Risk categorization consistency
- Separation of analytical logic from transactional data

### Risk Dimensions
- Financial Risk: Based on spend concentration
- Operational Risk: Based on overdue performance
- Efficiency Risk: Based on PO fragmentation indicators


# Vendor Risk Assessment

This section evaluates key vendors across three risk dimensions:
- Financial Risk (spend concentration)
- Operational Risk (purchase order delays)
- Efficiency Risk (PO fragmentation)

Risk levels are classified using relative benchmarks derived from the dataset.

## Risk Classification Rules

### Financial Risk
- 🔴 High: Spend ≥ 40%
- 🟠 Medium: Spend between 15% and 39.99%
- 🟢 Low: Spend < 15%

### Operational Risk
- 🔴 High: Overdue Rate ≥ 75%
- 🟠 Medium: Overdue Rate ≥ Overall Average (66.57%)
- 🟢 Low: Overdue Rate < Overall Average

### Efficiency Risk
- 🔴 High: Low average PO value combined with high PO count
- 🟠 Medium: Moderate PO fragmentation
- 🟢 Low: High average PO value and limited PO count

## Vendor Risk Summary

| Vendor | Financial Risk | Operational Risk | Efficiency Risk | Key Rationale |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Vendor K |      🔴      |        🟢       |       🟠      | High spend concentration with relatively efficient delivery performance; moderate PO fragmentation. |
| Vendor G |      🟠      |        🔴       |       🟢      | Moderate spend concentration with high overdue rate indicating vendor-specific operational risk. |
| Vendor D |      🟠      |        🟠       |       🟢      | Moderate spend with overdue rate aligned to average; highly efficient PO sizing. |
| Vendor F |      🟢      |        🟠       |       🔴      | Low spend concentration but significant PO fragmentation and mild operational delays. |
| Vendor B |      🟢      |        🔴       |       🔴      | Minimal financial exposure but high overdue rate and inefficient purchasing patterns. |
