## Calculated Columns

### Unified Net Amount
```DAX
-- Converts Net Amount to the unified currency
Unified Net Amount =
'PO Report'[Net Amount] * RELATED ( 'exchange rate'[exchange rate] )

  -- Converts Sales Tax to the unified currency
Unified Sales Tax =
'PO Report'[Sales Tax] * RELATED ( 'exchange rate'[exchange rate] )

 -- Converts Sub Total to the unified currency
Unified Subtotal =
'PO Report'[Sub Total] * RELATED ( 'exchange rate'[exchange rate] )
 
## Adjusted Overdue > 30 Days

An adjusted logic was introduced after identifying inconsistencies in the original overdue flag.

The adjusted measure ensures accurate classification of overdue purchase orders exceeding 30 days, improving reliability of risk analysis.

Adjusted Overdue>30 = IF(
    'PO Report'[Is Overdue] = "No",
     "False",
    "True"
)
