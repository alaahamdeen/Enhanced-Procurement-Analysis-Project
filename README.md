## 🔍 Milestone 02 — Exploratory Analysis (In Progress)


### Initial Vendor Concentration Observations

- Vendor K represents a significant share of total confirmed spend compared to other vendors.
- Spend is heavily concentrated in Project I, which is the highest-value project.
- Procurement activity shows a high number of warehouse-related purchase orders for this vendor.
- Further analysis is required to assess procurement efficiency and potential vendor dependency.
